Keynote Title: From Timing and Energy Analysis to Testing


Abstract:

Worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis of real-time software aids in schedulability decisions. In the recent past, worst case response time (WCRT) aware system designs have been studied, specifically in the context of mulit-core systems. In this talk, we will first focus on formal WCRT analysis of software for multi-cores with detailed modeling of shared bus/caches as embodied in the extended 
Chronos analysis tool for multi-cores. As a by-product of the platform modeling in timing analysis, systematic test generation capturing a spectrum of timing behavior can be identified. This  contrasts with the alternative approach where measurements are used to generate tests capturing pernicious timing / energy behavior. We will study the pro-s and cons of both approaches in concrete settings.
The ability to generate tests from platform timing models, also opens up the possibility of generating tests to demonstrate cache side channel attacks as embodied in the latest Meltdown and Spectre attacks.
