		  <p><strong>IEEE ISORC</strong> was founded in 1998 (with its first meeting in Kyoto, Japan) to address 
                   research into the application of real-time object-oriented distributed technology. 
                   Since then,  ISORC has continually evolved to meet the latest challenges faced by researchers and practitioners in the 
                   real-time domain, with an emphasis on object-, component- and service- oriented systems and solutions.</p>
          
                   <p>ISORC is a <strong>single-track conference,</strong> with a lively community. 
                   We have hosted a number of associated workshops, and are  proud of our spirit of openness. 
                   We seek to encourage diverse views and new approaches to all Real-Time Issues and Challenges for novel 
                   applications and systems in RT computing issues.

		    <b>Title:</b> From Timing and Energy Analysis to Testing</p>
            <b>Abstract:</b> Worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis of real-time software aids in schedulability decisions. In the recent past, worst case response time (WCRT) aware system designs have been studied, specifically in the context of mulit-core systems. In this talk, we will first focus on formal WCRT analysis of software for multi-cores with detailed modeling of shared bus/caches as embodied in the extended Chronos analysis tool for multi-cores. As a by-product of the platform modeling in timing analysis, systematic test generation capturing a spectrum of timing behavior can be identified. This  contrasts with the alternative approach where measurements are used to generate tests capturing pernicious timing / energy behavior. We will study the pro-s and cons of both approaches in concrete settings.
The ability to generate tests from platform timing models, also opens up the possibility of generating tests to demonstrate cache side channel attacks as embodied in the latest Meltdown and Spectre attacks.

		    <b>Title:</b> Towards Assurance-based Learning-enabled Cyber-Physical Systems</p>
            <b>Abstract:</b> Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are increasingly incorporating what one can call Learning-Enabled Components (LEC) to implement complex functions. By LEC we mean a component (typically, but not exclusively, implemented in software) that is realized with the help of data-driven techniques, like machine learning. For example, an LEC in an autonomous car can implement a lane follower function such that one trains an appropriate convolutional neural network with a stream of images of the road as input and the observed actions of a human driver as output. The claim is that such LEC built via supervised learning is easier to implement than building a very complex, image processing driven control system that steers the car such that it stays on the road. In other words, if the straightforward design and engineering is too difficult, a neural network can do the job – after sufficient amount of training. For high-consequence systems the challenge is to prove that the resulting system is safe: it does no harm, and it is live: it accomplishes its goals. Safety is perhaps the foremost problem in autonomous vehicles, especially for ones that operate in a less-regulated environment, like the road network. The traditional technology for proving the safety of systems is based on extensively documented but often informal arguments – that are very hard to apply to CPS with LEC.</b>
			
			The talk will focus on a recently started project that aims at changing this paradigm by introducing (1) formal verification techniques whenever possible (including proving properties of the ‘learned’ component), and (2) formalizing the safety case argumentation process so that it can be dynamically evaluated. The application target is autonomous vehicles, with significant, but not exclusively used LECs. The goal is to construct an engineering process and a supporting toolchain that can be used for the systematic assurance of CPS with LECs.
